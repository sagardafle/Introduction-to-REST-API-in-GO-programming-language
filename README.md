Lab 2 (httprouter.go)
A simple “Hello World” REST API in Go to understand how handler and Http router work, and how to parse the request and send the response.

Open this URL in a web browser: http://localhost:8080/hello/Daffy This prints: Hello, Daffy!

The response of the POST method is: Response: { “greeting” : “Hello, Daffy!” }
This also works fine in POSTman client
